Provide an explanation of each of these and example products ASW offers. 
This exercise is to be uploaded to your GitHub as a Short Report. 


1.Cloud computing
Cloud computing is the delivery of different services over the Internet. These resources include tools and applications, such as data storage, servers, databases, networks, and software.
Cloud-based storage can save files to a remote database instead of keeping the files on a dedicated hard drive or local storage device. In this way, it is possible to connect to the Internet through electronic devices anywhere in the world to access remote data and run its software.
Cloud computing is named as such because the information being accessed is found remotely in the cloud or a virtual space. Companies that provide cloud services enable users to store files and applications on remote servers and then access all the data via the Internet. This means the user is not required to be in a specific place to gain access to it, allowing the user to work remotely.

Cloud computing takes all the heavy lifting involved in crunching and processing data away from the device you carry around or sit and work at. It also moves all of that work to huge computer clusters far away in cyberspace. The Internet becomes the cloud, and voilà—your data, work, and applications are available from any device with which you can connect to the Internet, anywhere in the world.

Cloud computing can be both public and private. Public cloud services provide their services over the Internet for a fee. Private cloud services, on the other hand, only provide services to a certain number of people. These services are a system of networks that supply hosted services. There is also a hybrid option, which combines elements of both the public and private services.
2.
Cloud services can be private and public. Public services are to provide online paid service, while personal service are hosted on a network to specific clients.

3.Businesses can employ cloud computing in different ways. Some users maintain all apps and data on the cloud, while others use a hybrid model, keeping certain apps and data on private servers and others on the cloud.
